🧠 SCIENTIFIC-CALCULATOR-GUI 🖥️🐢
A sleek, functional, and creative Scientific Calculator built with Python Turtle!

✨ About the Project
SCIENTIFIC-CALCULATOR-GUI is a modern spin on traditional calculators, designed using the Turtle graphics library in Python.
It offers not just basic arithmetic operations, but also powerful scientific functions — all wrapped inside a colorful, interactive graphical interface.

Whether you're a coding enthusiast, a math lover, or someone who enjoys building creative GUI projects, this calculator is built for you!

🚀 Features
🎯 Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

🧩 Scientific Functions:
➔ Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan)
➔ Logarithmic (log, ln)
➔ Exponential and Power calculations

🎨 Custom Turtle-based GUI:
➔ Buttons, displays, and layout crafted with turtle drawing.
🖌️ Smooth, colorful design and responsive clicks

🛠️ Lightweight — No heavy frameworks required!

🛠️ Built With
Python 3.x
Turtle Library (Standard with Python)

📷 Preview
(Imagine a beautiful calculator drawn with turtle shapes, colorful buttons, and a smart layout)
(Optional: I can also help you create a sample preview image if you want!)

🔥 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Install Python 3.x (if not installed)

How to Run
python scientific_calculator_gui.py

🧠 How It Works
Turtle Canvas is used to draw the calculator body and buttons.
Mouse Click Events are captured to detect which button is pressed.
Mathematical Functions from Python's math library are triggered based on user input.
Display area is updated dynamically after each calculation.

💡 Why Turtle?
While Turtle is often used for fun drawings, this project redefines its potential — showing that even real-world functional apps like calculators can be built with it!
It’s a fun, visual way to learn event-driven programming, GUI layout design, and math handling all at once.

🌟 Future Enhancements
Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
Dark mode GUI
Keyboard input support (not just mouse clicks)
