GraphiCalc
A Scientific Calculator with a Graphical Twist — Built using Python's Turtle Library

✨ About GraphiCalc
GraphiCalc is a modern scientific calculator that brings together mathematical power and visual creativity.
Built using Python's Turtle graphics library, it offers a unique and interactive GUI for performing basic to advanced calculations — all while keeping the design visually appealing and lightweight.
Whether you are a student, developer, or just a Python enthusiast, GraphiCalc is a fun and functional tool that blends calculation precision with graphical creativity!

🚀 Features
🧮 Perform Scientific Calculations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Square, Square Root, and more!)
🎨 Creative GUI using Turtle Graphics
🐢 Lightweight and Fast — No heavy frameworks, pure Python!
📱 Responsive Design — Easy to use with mouse clicks
🔥 Intuitive Button Layout
🎯 Keyboard-free — Fully GUI-driven input

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Turtle Library (Standard Python Module)

📋 How It Works
Turtle is used to design buttons and display numbers graphically.
Clicking the buttons triggers different math operations in the backend.
Result is displayed on the Turtle screen itself, making it a complete visual calculator experience.

💻 How to Run Locally
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
Clone or download the repository.
Install any missing modules (although Turtle comes pre-installed with Python).
Run the script:
python graphiCalc.py

Future Enhancements
Add scientific functions like trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan).
Improve the graphical styling with themes.
Introduce keyboard support for faster calculations.
Add error handling for invalid operations.
